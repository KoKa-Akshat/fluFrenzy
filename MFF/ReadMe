# Flu Frenzy — Agent-Based Disease Spread Simulation

## Overview
Flu Frenzy is an agent-based simulation that models infectious disease spread under different parameters (e.g., transmission rate, movement, recovery time). The project visualizes outcomes over time and allows quick scenario testing.

## Features
- Interactive simulation / visualization
- Configurable parameters (infection, recovery, movement)
- Reproducible runs for comparison across scenarios

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Ensure Python is installed (Python 3.x).
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`  (only if you create this file)
4. Run:
   - `python MFF_Flu_Frenzy.py`

## Assets
This project uses image assets for the UI/visualization. Place the contents of `/assets` in the same directory as `MFF_Flu_Frenzy.py` (or keep the repo structure and update file paths in code).

## Repository Structure
- `MFF_Flu_Frenzy.py` — main program
- `tests/` — test files (optional)
- `assets/` — image assets
- `README.md` — project overview and instructions

## Sample Output
Include a screenshot or GIF here of the simulation running.
